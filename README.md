A simple API that gives you a recipe depending on what ingredients you have at home.

## Usage

To use the API, you have two options. Community and Personal. The easy version is where you just use the pre hosted API along with others. The second option is to use the Personal version. 

### Personal Version

Note: You require Node.JS installed for this app.

1. Download the files.
2. Run ```npm i express mongoose body-parser``` to install the dependencies. 
3. Open config.json and fill in the details.
4. Run ```node app.js``` and visit the specified port.

### Community Version

The community version of Cookbook will soon be ready! It will be a simple API hosted by me. Please use the personal version for now!
